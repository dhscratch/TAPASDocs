<TEI xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
   <teiHeader><!-- the tei header records information about the encoded document under <fileDesc>, <encodingDesc>, <profileDesc>. TEI headers come in all shapes and sizes, and include a widerange of information based on the source document or purpose of project to which it belongs. However, in all cases, headers must include at a minimum a fileDesc. -->
      <fileDesc><!-- fileDesc is a required header section. It is where we record bibliographic information of the encoded document. For <fileDesc> to be valid, it must include at a minumum <titleStmt>, <publicationStmt>, and <sourceDesc> subsections -->
         <titleStmt><!-- titleStmt is mandatory. It groups elements for recording information about the title of a work and those responsible, at various levels, for the creation or editorial work of its content.-->
            <title><!-- title of the document. The format of our title will depend on whether the document is the first of its kind (e.g., this is the  first edition of the "TAPAS Templates: a Minimally Encoded Header") or an encoded edition of a historical source document (e.g., Oscar Wilde's "The Importance of Being Earnest"). In the former, the title is straightforward in so far as the originator decides the document title; in the latter, one may choose to preserve the orginal historical title (e.g., "The Importance of Being Earnest") to emphasize the historical object being encoded. However, as one would be creating a new edition (of many other possible editions) of the source work in the TEI, it is considered best practice to reflect that the new object is an iteration of a source object: e.g., "Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest: a TEI Edition." To record the original source title (and other bibliographic data), we can use <bibl> under <sourceDesc>. In this case, we would include the original source creator under <author> (e.g., Oscar Wilde), and record the TEI edition's creator/encoder under <respStmt>. -->Title of Source Work</title>
            <author><!-- name of source object author or an organization reseponsible for producing the work; repeat <author> for multiauthored works; we can also nest <persName> in <author> for asssociating author with a personography --><persName> Author name <!-- (could also use <gi>orgName</gi>, for organizations) -->
